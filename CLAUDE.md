# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Aura is a **peer-to-peer Magic: The Gathering tabletop app** with a goal 
of becoming a generic card-game platform with MTG specifics (command 
zone, commander auto-draw) as plugins. Players share 
a collaborative whiteboard via WebRTC/WebSockets — there is no backend for 
game state. All real-time sync uses **Yjs CRDTs** over **y-webrtc**. The 
only backend is a card-import API (Aura backend → Scryfall fallback). That
backend lives in this repo at `mtg_card_search/` — a Python/FastAPI service
with its own venv, tests (`pytest tests/` from its directory), and deployment
docs (`mtg_card_search/SETUP.md`). See `mtg_card_search/CLAUDE.md` before
working there (notably: never read files under `mtg_card_search/cards/` in
full — they're multi-GB NDJSON).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev             # start dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build           # production build
npm run test:run        # run unit tests once (vitest)
npm run test:coverage   # vitest run --coverage
npm run test:e2e:smoke  # run smoke tests
npm run test:e2e        # run e2e tests
npm run verify          # single command for fast change verification 
npm test                # vitest watch mode
npx vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts   # single test file
npx playwright test     # e2e tests (requires dev server running)
npx tsc --noEmit        # type-check
```

## Branch workflow

**Branch off `staging`, open PRs into `staging`.** Never work off `master` or
target it directly. `staging` is the long-lived integration branch (and the
repo default), so `git clone` / new branches start there by default:

```bash
git switch staging && git pull
git switch -c feature/x     # do the work, then open a PR into staging
```

`master` is the **production/release** branch — Cloudflare Workers Builds
deploys it to `aura0.app` on every push. It advances *only* via a single
`staging → master` promotion PR once changes are verified on
`staging.aura0.app`. Direct pushes to `master` are blocked by a local
`pre-push` hook (`.husky/pre-push`); override an intentional one with
`ALLOW_MASTER_PUSH=1 git push …`.

The one exception is a **production hotfix** that can't wait for what's in
staging: branch off `master`, PR into `master`, then back-merge
`master → staging`. This is a human call — not a default. Full flow and the
Cloudflare/GitHub setup are in [`docs/deployment/STAGING.md`](docs/deployment/STAGING.md).

## Architecture

### Entry point flow
`src/app/main.ts` → `bootstrapGame()` (in `bootstrap.ts`) → mounts `<App>` into `#app-react-root`.

`bootstrapGame()` is the imperative wiring layer: it creates `Y.Doc`, networking, `Player`, and services in dependency order, then populates Zustand stores before React renders. Everything returned from `bootstrapGame()` is passed as props to `<App>`. There are no more imperative UI classes — `PileViewer` (the last one, a detached `createRoot` wrapper in `features/game-dock/`) was retired in favor of `PileViewerReact` mounted normally in the tree.

### State: two layers
1. **Yjs** — source of truth for all shared game state. Access via `yDoc.getMap(YDOC_*)` constants from `src/constants.ts`. Key maps: `YDOC_CARDS_ON_BOARD` (battlefield cards), `YDOC_KEYWORD_TOKENS` (board tokens), `YDOC_PLAYER(id)` (per-player state: hand, deck, health, etc.).
2. **Zustand** — UI-only state (`src/stores/`). `gameInstanceStore` holds `yDoc`, `player`, `playerId`, `roomManager` so hotkeys and components don't need prop-drilling. `hotkeyStore` tracks what's hovered (`hoverTarget`) and modal state. Never put game mutations in Zustand — they belong in Yjs.

### Feature directories (`src/features/`)
Each feature owns its UI, business logic, and types.

### Battlefield (react-flow)
`BattlefieldCanvas` wraps `<ReactFlow>` with controlled nodes driven by `useBattlefieldNodes`. The bridge observes `yCards`/`yTokens` and calls `setNodes`; drag writes back to Yjs only on `onNodeDragStop`. Board-to-dock card moves go through `battlefieldActions.moveCardFromBattlefield`. Hand-to-board drops call `battlefieldActions.playCardFromHand`; keyword-token drops are handled inside `BattlefieldCanvas.onDrop` via `screenToFlowPosition`.

### Hotkey system
`useAllGameHotkeys` (mounted in `<GameHotkeysManager>`) reads `hoverTarget` from `hotkeyStore` to route contextual actions to the right surface (battlefield card, hand card, pile, token). Modal state switches between `HotkeyScope.Board` and `HotkeyScope.PileViewer` via `react-hotkeys-hook`'s `<HotkeysProvider>`. The context menu (`HotkeyMenu`) is a Radix Popover opened imperatively via `useHotkeyMenuStore.getState().openMenu(...)`.

### Path aliases
`@/` maps to `src/`. Use it everywhere — no relative `../../` imports across features.

## Design Philosophy

**Extensible and self-documenting over simple.** When choosing where to put logic, prefer the location that makes the code correct by default for all future callers — not the one that's shortest. An action like `playCardFromHand` names a complete game action; if callers have to remember to also trigger token creation afterward, the name lies and every new call-site is a latent bug.

**Complete semantic actions.** Store actions represent full game events with all their consequences. Side effects (token creation, analytics, persistence) belong inside the action, not scattered at call sites. This means: if you add a new way to play a card from hand (hotkey, pile drag, etc.), it gets token creation for free.

**Caller should not need to know implementation details.** If playing a card creates tokens, that is not the UI layer's concern. The UI layer says what happened (a card was played); the action layer decides what that means (place card + spawn related tokens).

**Yjs mutations always go through `Player`** for player-state (hand, deck, health). For battlefield objects, write directly to `yDoc.getMap(YDOC_CARDS_ON_BOARD)`. Never use `player.yPlayerState` directly from outside `Player.ts`.

**No more window events for cross-module communication.** Battlefield→dock card moves (`features/battlefield/battlefieldActions.ts`), pile-viewer open requests, and the scry viewer's close handling all go through Zustand stores, direct Yjs access, or plain component state.

**`src/components/`** holds modals and cross-feature UI (used by more than one feature). Feature-specific UI belongs in `src/features/<feature>/`. Generic primitives and shadcn components belong in `src/shared/`.

## Testing

Unit tests: vitest + happy-dom + React Testing Library. Files live next to source (`*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`). Test helpers for Yjs: create a real `Y.Doc` rather than mocking it. Conventions (query ladder, mocking policy, harness, reference examples) are in `tests/testing-react.md` — follow `CardPreview.test.tsx`, not `DeckImportModal.test.tsx`.

E2e tests: Playwright under `tests/e2e/`. Write specs through `tests/e2e/harness/` (page objects, interactions, semantic waits, domain assertions, scenarios) — never raw selectors, `dragTo()`, `waitForTimeout`, or mouse teleports (`locator.click()`/`page.mouse.click()` jump straight to the target; hover-sensitive interactions need real incremental `page.mouse.move(x, y, { steps: N })` travel — see `mouseDrag`). Full contract in `docs/testing/e2e.md`; `tests/testing.md` has PileViewer/dnd-kit mechanics notes.
